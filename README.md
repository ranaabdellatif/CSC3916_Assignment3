# Assignment Three
## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to get comfortable working with a NoSQL database (MongoDB). 

For this assignment you will create a Users collection to store users for your signup and signin methods.  You will pass Username, Name and Password as part of signup.  To get a token you will call SingIn with username and password only.  The token should include the Name and UserName (not password)

You will also create Movies collection to store information about movies.  All endpoints will be protected with the JWT token received by a signin call.
